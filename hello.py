# Welcome!
#
# If you're editing this code locally on whatever Python IDE you prefer, congratulations
# on cloning into a Git Repo successfully!
#
# On a separate branch (and following the instructions in the blog post)
# edit the code below, and try to make a Pull Request.
#
# Some possible modifications:
# - Add a lengthier message
# - Add a conditional to the greeting
# - Add a few other function calls
#
# I know this code is very trivial, but that's intentional - so we can focus on Git!
#
# Good luck!


def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}.")

greet("Git")
